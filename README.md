# Predicting-the-winner-of-tennis-matches-in-ATP
The goal is to estimate the likelihood of “wins” in tennis matches of the men’s ATP tour. A win happens when a higher-ranked player wins the match against a lower-ranked player. I selected a range of 2 years. The Grand Slam tournaments generally adopt the concept of Best of 5, while the other tournaments 4 follow the Best of 3. I selected the three classifiers as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest to make the predictions on both structures. Plotting the ROC curves along with win probability gives us a fair idea for predicting.
